**Usage instructions**
Important: The script currently uses relative paths, which makes it mendatory to only run the script from within the "win-audit" folder!

0. Unpack the win-audit folder
1. Launch powershell as >admin<
2. Use cd to change the directory to the win-audit folder
3. Run .\assessment_start.ps1
4. Send us the results.zip back
5. If it was not created zip the results folder on your own and send it back (we will most likely ask you to execute it again at a later date)
